# Fuel-MPG-Project
The main objective of this project was to learn how to deploy and end-to-end Machine Learning project using Flask and Heroku. The model is based on the [Auto MPG Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG) in order to predict the miles per gallon a vehicle consumes using 3 multivalued discrete features and 5 continues.

Through [this guided project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/end-to-end-machine-learning-project-turorial/) I learned to use the basic of Flask and Heroku for deploying future machine learning projects.
